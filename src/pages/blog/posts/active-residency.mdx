Active residency is usually the best fit for people who plan to build their life and economic activity in Andorra. If you are launching a company, moving an existing business, or working locally on a long-term basis, this route is typically the most strategic one.

## What "active residency" means

In simple terms, active residency is tied to professional or business activity. You are not only living in Andorra, you are also contributing to the local economy through work, company ownership, or self-employment.

For many applicants, this creates a strong long-term foundation because residence status and business planning are aligned from day one.

## Who this route is best for

Active residency can be a strong option for:

- Entrepreneurs opening an Andorran company
- Consultants and self-employed professionals serving international clients
- Business owners relocating operations to Andorra
- Founders who want a low-tax jurisdiction with high quality of life

## Key benefits people look for

Most families and founders choose this route for a combination of reasons:

- Access to a safe, stable European environment
- Competitive personal and corporate tax framework
- Strong lifestyle: nature, schools, and clean urban infrastructure
- A clear path to establish real local substance

## Planning points before you apply

Before filing, focus on preparation. Good planning reduces delays and helps avoid rework with documents.

Important areas to map early:

- Legal structure and ownership setup
- Business model and expected local presence
- Proof of funds and supporting documentation
- Housing timeline and relocation logistics for family members

## Final note

Active residency is not only an immigration step. It is a strategic relocation decision that combines tax, legal, business, and lifestyle planning. A structured approach early on usually leads to a smoother approval process and a stronger long-term setup in Andorra.
