Passive residency is designed for people who want to live in Andorra without depending on local employment. It is often chosen by investors, retirees, remote earners, and internationally mobile families who want a secure base in Europe.

## What "passive residency" means

With passive residency, your residence status is generally based on financial capacity and compliance requirements rather than local labor activity. In practice, applicants must show they can support themselves and meet the program conditions.

This route is attractive when your income is generated outside Andorra or you are focused on asset and family planning rather than local operations.

## Who this route is best for

Passive residency is commonly used by:

- Investors diversifying their personal residency footprint
- Families relocating for safety and quality of life
- Remote professionals with international income streams
- People planning a medium- to long-term move with lower local business obligations

## Why people choose passive residency

The decision is often a mix of practical and lifestyle drivers:

- Political and social stability
- High personal safety
- Clean environment and mountain lifestyle
- Access to a favorable tax environment when properly structured

## Preparation checklist

A strong file depends on organization. The most successful applications usually start with a complete checklist and realistic timing.

Core preparation items include:

- Financial evidence and source-of-funds clarity
- Investment and deposit planning
- Health coverage and documentation package
- Property, schooling, and relocation plan for dependents

## Final note

Passive residency can be an excellent option when your priority is lifestyle, family security, and international tax planning. The key is to build a compliant structure from the beginning so your move is both smooth and sustainable over time.
